The purpose of ALP is the load a set of shell functions for use with creating tiny hashes to embed into relatively large Satoshi Codes (Advances Satoshi Codes) via cryptocurrency transactions.  The codes can modify existing transaction as a sort of externally recorded memo.  The codes can also be sent to Obviously Unspendable Addresses which spell out human-readable messages with the intention of being externally referenced in legal documents.  Furthermore, it appears that the DiMECASH linguistic system can nicely make use of the bitcoin-cli sendmany command in order to transmit large and quite obvious messages which may or may not be attached to any true financial transaction.

This system is Open-Source, covered by an Apache 2.0 license. 

ALP is basically one bash library located in ~/alp/alp.bash.  It can be sourced into a shell environment and used in order to create what I call secrets, but are tightly self-referential bash functions which map to either a five or seven digit number.  The five-digit is recreatable without the ALP package, and the seven-digit version is significantly stronger and can be trivially recreated by any savy bash user or by simply downloading this package.

The portability of the system is key.

ALP is part of an elaborate system of inter-connected tools which also includes a fork of litecoin called DiMECASH.  Work on this project has been halted because existing cryptocurrencies are perfectly useable and in the the DiMECASH linguistic tendency is financially at odds with the currency price.

In order to further promote the open and flexible nature of ALP, it can be used by any individual or corporation, but in using it in conjuction with a shared ledger should be considered a Secular Religious endeavor.  In other words, if some entity were to attempt collection on an patent infringement, they would face a defacto religious freedom counter because this system is thus recorded as being of a fundamentally secular nature.  

After an exhaustive inspection of the laws and practices surrounding charitable and religious organizations, it is my assessment that a group would almost always do better to form as a religous entitity and eventually gain full legal church-hood.  This extends also to Closely Held Corporations which are now allowed to essentially be of a certain religion.

As I am a devout Secularist (Please see Charles Taylor's 'A Secular Age'), I personally claim to practice an expedient secular form of religion which I call Soirism and would refer to an ALP function/secret as a Soirentz.  This may seem like an odd claim, but it for a purely Utilitarian purpose.

No really guys, this is really a religion.  Don't fuck with me.
