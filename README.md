The purpose of ALP is the load a set of shell functions for use with creating tiny hashes to embed into relatively large Satoshi Codes (Advances Satoshi Codes) into cryptocurrency transactions.  The codes can modify existing transaction as a sort of externally recorded memo.  The codes can also be sent to Obviously Unspendable Addresses which spell out human-readable messages with the intention of being externally referenced in legal documents.

This system is Open-Source, covered by an Apache 2.0 license. 

ALP is basically one bash library located in ~/alp/alp.bash.  It can be sourced into a shell environment and used in order to create what I call secrets, but are tightly self-referential bash functions which map to either a five or seven digit number.  The five-digit is recreatable without the ALP package, and the seven-digit version is significantly stronger and can be trivially recreated by any savy bash user or by simply downloading this package.

The portability of the system is key.

ALP is part of an elaborate system of inter-connected tools which also includes a fork of litecoin called dimecash.

In order to further promote the open and flexible nature of ALP, it can be used by any individual or corporation, but in using it in conjuction with a shared ledger should be considered a Secular Religious endeavor.  I will actively seek legal justification for this.

After an exhaustive inspection of the laws and practices surrounding charitable and religious organizations, it is my assessment that a group would almost always do better to form as a religous entitity and eventually gain full legal church-hood.  This extends also to Closely Held Corporations which are now allowed to essentially be of a certain religion.

As I am a devout Secularist (Please see Charles Taylor's 'A Secular Age'), I personally claim to practice an expedient secular form of religion which I call Soirism and would refer to an ALP function/secret as a Soirentz.  This may seem like an odd claim, but it for a purely Utilitarian purpose.

Thanks, enjoy the madness and the many many opaque references to "Finnegans Wake"

 - written in a restricted bash shell, with curl access at the base level.
 - logs into various typescripts and history files 
 - maps to PHP pages which are rendered as a simple menu structure
 - keeps critical data memory resident and therefore hidden
 - should be very easy to understand
 - relies on shell inheritance and overloading
 - seeks to elucidate how cryptocurrency can be used in conjunction to religion and law
 - an abstract religion known as soirism is defacto declared by the use of this package
