# alp is a set of shell scripting conventions
# which create highly readable and understandable
# tasks for blockchain consumption
# It aims to live entirely within a restricted shell
# environment, which it opens.
# It also uses colors to denote child shell.  
# It has eight levels of color below the base
# and as one descends into these deeper levels
# then the nature of their tasks changes
# because blockchain executions will be coming from 
# base and adopted classes.
