This python script is available in on github:

https://github.com/johnrigler/unspendable

The command requires at least one parameter, if two
are given, the second is transformed into a Base58-hash
language which is of course limited, yet still quite
readable. I use these in conjunction bitcoin and its
variants. Messages can be placed into the ledger and
then later discovered in a myriad of ways.

Example:

unspendable.py DCx "this is the stuff"
DCxTHiSxiSxTHExSTUFFzzzzzzzzbSG1oo
